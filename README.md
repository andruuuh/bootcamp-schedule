# Personal Repo

## This Repo is used to track my progress within this awesome bootcamp ♥️

### TIL (Today I learned) - updated on daily basis
#### 1st Day of School: 30.08.2021
- I learned what GitHub is and why it's useful. 
- I managed to set up a README.md file on each of my two Repos available atm.
- And, last but not least, I'm getting familiar with GitHub and its awesome scope.
- Right now, I'm up to download VS Code and a few extensions to customize VS Code the way required for the Camp.
