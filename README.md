# Personal Repo

## This Repo is used to track my progress within this awesome bootcamp ♥️

### TIL (Today I learned) - updated on daily basis
#### 1st Day of School: 30.08.2021

**PROGRAMMING**
- I learned what GitHub is and why it's useful. 
- I managed to set up a README.md file on each of my two Repos available atm.
- And, last but not least, I'm getting familiar with GitHub and its awesome scope.
- Right now, I'm up to download VS Code and a few extensions to customize VS Code the way required for the Camp.

**SOFT SKILLS**
- The Camp is also very helpful improving my soft skills, such as communication and teaching.
- I was able to help other students fixing their bugs or show them an alternative way to achive their goal. Loved it.

#### 2nd Day of School: 31.08.2021

**PROGRAMMING**
- Today, we talked about the Terminal a lot. I was and still am getting more and more familiar and comfortable with it. I now know, why I love Linux this much ❤️.
- Right know, I thought about making my README at least a little prettier and more readable and discovered how to make a horizontal line. One way is doin it like this -> `***`

**SOFT SKILLS**
- We finally got our Buddy for the next two weeks. I was and still am a little concerned about mine, cause he missed out the whole afternoon and I can't reach him as well. Hope, he's doin good either way.
- I learned, that the Class is always down for a helping hand. Wanna mention Cecilia, who had my back at 10 pm. We learned and helped eachother simultaneously and discovered our break-throughs.

#### 3rd Day of School: 01.09.2021

**PROGRAMMING**
- Okay, now we're talking. We dived into HTML. Basic structure, lists, Navigationbar, these kinda things. Not this new for me, tbh, but I did consolidate my previous knowledge. Bottom line: You'll never stop learning.

**SOFT SKILLS**
- This is the third day of school, and also the third day of rising by lifting others. I could not tell you, how awesome this feeling is. You have to discover it by yourself. If there's someone in class needing a helping hand, I'm always there. As well as the other attendees are there for me, too. The smile on Leonels face, when I was able to fix his bug was priceless and such a pleasure, that he mentioned me in the Recap at the end of the day. I'll sleep very good tonight. Indeed.


**Enough for today, it is getting late.. see y'all tomorrow.**
